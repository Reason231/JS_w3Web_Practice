1. Design a Vehicle System
Question: Design a class called Vehicle that includes properties such as make, model, and year. Include a method start() that prints a message saying the vehicle is starting. Create subclasses Car and Motorcycle that inherit from Vehicle and override the start() method with a more specific message. Create an instance of each class and demonstrate polymorphism by calling the start() method on both instances.
Key Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Method Overriding

2. Shopping Cart System
Question: Create a class Item that represents an item in a shopping cart with properties name, price, and quantity. Write a method totalPrice() that calculates the total price for that item. Then, create a class ShoppingCart that holds multiple Item objects and calculates the total price for all items. Include a method addItem() to add an item to the cart and removeItem() to remove an item.
Key Concepts: Class Design, Object Composition, Encapsulation

3. Employee Management System
Question: Design an abstract class Employee with properties such as name, salary, and position. Include an abstract method calculateBonus() which will be implemented in subclasses Manager, Developer, and Intern. Each subclass should implement the calculateBonus() method differently based on their salary. Create instances of each class and calculate their bonuses.
Key Concepts: Abstract Class, Inheritance, Method Overriding

4. Library Management System
Question: Create a class Book with properties like title, author, and isbn. Include a method getDetails() that returns the book's details. Create a class Library that manages a collection of Book objects. Add methods to addBook(), removeBook(), and findBookByISBN(). Ensure that the Library uses encapsulation to manage its collection of books privately.
Key Concepts: Encapsulation, Class Design, Composition

5. Bank Account System
Question: Design a class BankAccount with properties accountNumber, balance, and owner. Include methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) that update the balance. Then, create subclasses SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount with specific rules for deposits and withdrawals. For example, SavingsAccount might have a minimum balance requirement, and CheckingAccount could have a limited number of free transactions.
Key Concepts: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Method Overriding

6. E-Commerce System
Question: Create a class Product with properties name, price, and category. Then create a class DiscountedProduct that inherits from Product and adds a discount property. Override the method getPrice() to apply the discount if applicable. Write a method to calculate the total price of multiple products, including discounted ones, and return the final price.
Key Concepts: Inheritance, Method Overriding, Class Design

7. Hotel Reservation System
Question: Design a class Room that represents a hotel room with properties like roomNumber, type (single, double), and rate. Create a class Reservation that manages the checkIn and checkOut dates and calculates the total price based on the number of days. Include a method reserveRoom() that reserves the room and updates the roomâ€™s status.
Key Concepts: Object Composition, Encapsulation, Class Design

8. School Management System
Question: Create a class Person with properties name and age. Create two subclasses Student and Teacher, where Student has an additional property grade and Teacher has a property subject. Override a method getDetails() in both classes to display personalized details for each type. Implement a method assignGrade(student, grade) in the Teacher class that assigns a grade to a student.
Key Concepts: Inheritance, Method Overriding, Encapsulation

9. Inventory Management System
Question: Create a class Product with properties like productID, name, stock, and price. Write methods to addStock() and reduceStock() for the product. Create a class Warehouse that manages multiple Product objects and includes methods to checkStock() and listProducts().
Key Concepts: Object Composition, Encapsulation, Class Design

10. Ride-Sharing System
Question: Create a class Vehicle with properties like licensePlate and driverName. Create subclasses Car, Bike, and Truck, each with a method getCapacity() that returns the capacity of the vehicle (e.g., car: 4, bike: 2, truck: 8). Write a class RideShare that manages a fleet of vehicles and matches vehicles to ride requests based on capacity.
