Step-by-Step Execution
Initial Call: amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])

1. Check: 46 >= 25 (true)
Action: Use coin 25
Calculate: left = 46 - 25 = 21
Recursive Call: amountTocoins(21, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])
Result: [25] + result of the recursive call
Second Call: amountTocoins(21, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])

2. Check: 21 < 25 (false)
Action: Remove coin 25 from the list
Result: Call amountTocoins(21, [10, 5, 2, 1])
Third Call: amountTocoins(21, [10, 5, 2, 1])

3. Check: 21 >= 10 (true)
Action: Use coin 10
Calculate: left = 21 - 10 = 11
Recursive Call: amountTocoins(11, [10, 5, 2, 1])
Result: [10] + result of the recursive call
Fourth Call: amountTocoins(11, [10, 5, 2, 1])

4. Check: 11 >= 10 (true)
Action: Use coin 10
Calculate: left = 11 - 10 = 1
Recursive Call: amountTocoins(1, [10, 5, 2, 1])
Result: [10] + result of the recursive call
Fifth Call: amountTocoins(1, [10, 5, 2, 1])

5. Check: 1 < 10 (false)
Action: Remove coin 10 from the list
Result: Call amountTocoins(1, [5, 2, 1])
Sixth Call: amountTocoins(1, [5, 2, 1])

6. Check: 1 < 5 (false)
Action: Remove coin 5 from the list
Result: Call amountTocoins(1, [2, 1])
Seventh Call: amountTocoins(1, [2, 1])

7. Check: 1 < 2 (false)
Action: Remove coin 2 from the list
Result: Call amountTocoins(1, [1])
Eighth Call: amountTocoins(1, [1])

8. Check: 1 >= 1 (true)
Action: Use coin 1
Calculate: left = 1 - 1 = 0
Recursive Call: amountTocoins(0, [1])
Result: [1] + result of the recursive call
Base Case: amountTocoins(0, [1])

9. Check: amount === 0 (true)
Result: [] (no more coins needed)
Building Up the Results
Eighth Call: amountTocoins(1, [1]) returns [1]
Seventh Call: amountTocoins(1, [2, 1]) returns [2, 1] (since removing 2 results in [1])
Sixth Call: amountTocoins(1, [5, 2, 1]) returns [5, 2, 1] (since removing 5 results in [2, 1])
Fifth Call: amountTocoins(1, [10, 5, 2, 1]) returns [10, 5, 2, 1] (since removing 10 results in [5, 2, 1])
Fourth Call: amountTocoins(11, [10, 5, 2, 1]) returns [10, 10, 1] (since removing 10 results in [10, 1])
Third Call: amountTocoins(21, [10, 5, 2, 1]) returns [10, 10, 1] (since removing 10 results in [10, 1])
Second Call: amountTocoins(21, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1]) returns [25, 10, 10, 1] (since removing 25 results in [10, 10, 1])
Initial Call: amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1]) returns [25, 10, 10, 1]



Q. how the coins are removing from the list? i mean to say if the check is false , it removes the coin from where, we haven't created anything like this list plus how it is giving the call when we haven't used the loop condition 

- Removing Coins from the List
The coins.shift() method is used to remove the first coin from the list in JavaScript. This method modifies the original array by removing the first element and shifting all other elements to a lower index.

- Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works in the function:

- Removing the First Coin:

- When the amount is less than the value of the first coin in the list (coins[0]), the function uses coins.shift() to remove the first coin from the coins array. This changes the coins array in-place, so the next recursive call will not include this removed coin.
Effect on Recursion:

- After removing the coin, the function is called recursively with the updated coins array. This updated array no longer contains the removed coin.
Example of Coin Removal
Letâ€™s illustrate this with a simple example:

- Example to understand it.
let coins = [25, 10, 5, 2, 1];
coins.shift(); // removes the first coin, 25
console.log(coins); // outputs: [10, 5, 2, 1]
